const e="morvern are Jan Cizej, Miha Konrad and Jay",a=['What started in Trbovlje as singer-songwriter Jan Cizej’s treasure chest of lo-fi ideas, quickly found its place under the sun in Ljubljana’s indie scene. Releasing the music prolifically through the DIY label <a href="https://sop-records.org" target="_blank" rel="external">ŠOP Records</a>, Morvern found itself scaling up in size and shifting into a fully-fledged, touring workhorse of a band around 2018.',"As of now, the band consists of Jay on bass, Miha on drums, and Cizej continuing his triple role of singer-guitarist-writer. And while he might still be the band’s de-facto leader, his previous persona of Morvern as singular person has now been dissolved to mean Morvern as a group of like-minded, but unique individuals.","As a powerful three-piece, Morvern’s sound gradually shifted away from calming hallucinatory bedroom pop to fuzzy, loud assault of garage rock in order to satisfy the needs of the wild crowds they’ve encountered during touring, playing gigs all around their homeland of Slovenia as well as across the Balkans, crossing even the border of Bulgaria. Some of their notable gigs have been; at Samit Nesvrstanih 2024, a skate festival in Belgrade, Serbia; Ljubljana’s Kino Šiška in 2021; the Slovenian skate contest Flow Ramps in 2024 and 2025; KVART Festival in Varaždin, Croatia."],i=[{email:"morvern.band@gmail.com"}],n=[{text:`The one-man project of the prolific singer-songwriter/producer Jan Cizej has in recent years expanded into a playful five-piece ensemble, which on their home soil (Slovenia) persistently represents the indie underground unencumbered by trends. <i>Welcome To Hell</i>, a blend of lo-fi garage distortion, new-age psychedelia, and "hellish" b-horror aesthetics à la Braindead, is the most polished product in morvern's extensive, stylistically diverse discography (26 releases from 2017 onwards!). This retro-sounding, wittily self-deprecating album unburdenly flirts with the "trashy" tendencies of King Gizzard and the incendiary riffs in the style of multi-instrumentalist John Dwyer. But it is not parody or pastiche, but a completely sincere tribute to the old and new psych-rock guard.`,author:"Jaša Bužinel",publication:'<a href="https://www.mladina.si/227388/morvern-welcome-to-hell/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mladina</a>'},{text:"With ease, spontaneity, mischievousness, heartfelt devotion and manic productivity, he has earned a striking reputation in the domestic underground scene as a little public secret, whose fame is growing.",author:"Igor Bašin",publication:'<a href="https://www.sigic.si/slovo-od-samozadostnosti-.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Odzven</a>'},{text:"And the band morvern is exactly that: unconventional, imaginative, well-coordinated and, above all, passionate.",author:"Miroslav Akrapović",publication:'<a href="https://www.sigic.si/dobrodosli-v-svet-morvern.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Odzven</a>'}],t="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KmOCN1kzDndVTCLvVfKJ9_XAQLvZlSxd?usp=drive_link",o={intro:e,body:a,contact:i,press:n,epk:t};export{a as body,i as contact,o as default,t as epk,e as intro,n as press};
